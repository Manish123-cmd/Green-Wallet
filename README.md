# Green-Wallet
The Green Wallet project aims to address the growing challenge of motivating individuals to adopt sustainable habits by transforming everyday eco-friendly actions into measurable and rewarding outcomes. Many people care about the environment, yet behaviours such as saving water, recycling, or choosing public transport often feel unnoticed.
